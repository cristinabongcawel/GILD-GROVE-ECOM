# Gild + Grove E-Commerce Platform

As GitHub Copilot, I'm here to help explain your system. The system operates as a full-fledged e-commerce platform specifically designed for Gild + Grove, a brand specializing in selling perfumes, body mists, scrubs, and soaps. It leverages a modern technology stack, with a React-based frontend providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for customers and administrators alike. The backend is built using Node.js and Express, ensuring robust server-side logic, while MySQL serves as the database for storing critical data such as user information, product details, and transaction records. Additionally, Socket.IO is integrated to support real-time features, enabling instant updates and interactive elements like live chat or notifications.

The platform encompasses a wide range of functionalities to cater to both users and administrators. For customers, it includes essential features such as user registration and login, product browsing and management (focusing on the brand's perfume, body mist, scrub, and soap offerings), shopping cart operations, secure checkout processes, order tracking with detailed views, customer reviews and ratings, refund requests, and voucher redemption. On the administrative side, it offers comprehensive tools for managing categories, products, orders, user accounts, reviews, and overall dashboard analytics, allowing admins to monitor and control the e-commerce ecosystem effectively.

Currently, the backend server is running in the background on the system, likely on a standard port such as 3001 (confirm via console output for exact details), ensuring the platform's core services are active and ready for use. If the earlier request to "create a background" referred to something else—like adding a background image, setting up a background service, or initiating another process—or if assistance is needed to start the frontend or make further modifications, please provide more specifics!
